# Object-Oriented Programming
- programming paradigm
- based on the concepts of "objects".
- essentially evaluate an output for a given input.
- revolves around 4 principles:
    - Abstraction
    - Polymorphism
    - Inheritance
    - Encapsulation

# Imperative Programming
- programming paradigm
- tells the computer how to "accomplish" a program with the use of statements.
- does not support objects.
- essentially evaluate an output for a given input.

# Functional Programming
- key concepts:
    - **expressions**:
        - computes new values from old values
    - **functions**:
        - first class values
        - abstract over expressions
        - higher-order functions
        - can be built into composite values
    - **parametric polymorphism**:
        - a function operates on values of a type family rather than just one type
    - **data abstractions**:
        - the reduction of a particular body of data to a simplified representation of the whole. 
    - **lazy evaluation**:
        - relates to when an expression is evaluated.

# Logic Programming
- based on assertions, Horn clauses and relations
- a collection of _Horn clauses_
