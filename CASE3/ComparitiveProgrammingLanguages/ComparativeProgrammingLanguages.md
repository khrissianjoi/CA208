## Data, Types and Scope

### Types
Types are sets that defined by the values the set contains and the operations on these values.

#### Primitive Types
- cannot be decomposed into simplet values.

## Abstractions

### The Abstraction Principle
construct other types of procedures. 
This states that it is possible to design procedures that abstract over any syntactic category, provided only that the constructs in the syntactic category specify some kind of computation.
