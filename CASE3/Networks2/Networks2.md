# Routing

## RIP - Routing Information Protocol
- Distance Vector Routing Protocol
- Prevents count to infinity by limiting the number of hops over a netowkr
- Easier to configure
- Messages sent with UDP
- Time convergence (therefore not used)

## OSPF - Open Shortest Path First
- Dijkstras Shortest Path
- Fully classless
- Dimensionless arbitrary metric (route cost)
- Updates via multicase (not broadcast)
- Has authenication
- Tag external routes
